[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) was created primarily to help beginners learn Python or to help non-programmers reach another level of productivity with Python at work. I also have some suggestions on non-Python tools that I recommend using to improve office productivity.

The entire book is available to read for free online. It's presented in a very approachable way with exercises along the way to test your knowledge. There are also mini-projects for you to apply what you just learned.

I went through the text version, which was great. Al Sweigart, the author, has also created a video course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/automate/), if you prefer learning with a video format.

To give you an idea of some of the things you will learn from the book or video course, here's a list from the website of things you will be able to automate after completing the book:

  - Search for text in a file or across multiple files
  - Create, update, move, and rename files and folders
  - Search the Web and download online content
  - Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size
  - Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs
  - Send reminder emails and text notifications
  - Fill out online forms
