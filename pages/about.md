I am Head of Data at [Homads](https://homads.com) where we are applying data science and geospatial analysis to help make long-term rentals a better experience.
I am also a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of North Texas, concentrating on Political Theory and Political Behavior.

I like to think about the intersection of politics and technology, firmly believing that the education of virtuous citizens is key to a free and happy society.
I strive to approach problems holistically by using multiple methods and perspectives.

Aside from living in Dallas, TX, I also occasionally make my way down to Austin, TX.
Love to go rock climbing when I get a chance.
Big film fan.
Definitely open to chat or meet up for coffee!
